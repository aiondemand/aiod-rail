    <h1>Experiment Run</h1>
    <p>
        An instance of Experiment Run is created. This instance represents the current state of the running (and also
        finished) Experiment, its logs, metrics and outputs (if any). It is available in the Experiment detail page.
    </p>
    <p>
        When you run Experiment multiple times, the instructions sent to the AIoD REANA instance are always the same.
        This means that if the Python script does not contain any source of non-determinism, running the Experiment
        twice will always result in the same results. There are many sources of non-determinism, though - for example,
        if an Experiment Template defines a training script that randomly shuffles training data, the model (unless you
        fix the seeds) will always be different.

    <h1>Create Experiment Run = Execute Experiment</h1>
    <p>When you execute an Experiment, following happens:</p>
    <ol>
        <li>An instance of Experiment Run is created.&nbsp;</li>
        <li>The Experiment Run is transformed to a Common Workflow Language (CWL) file. This file represents the
            Experiment in the form of a workflow that is executable by AIoD platform infrastructure.</li>
        <li>The CWL file is sent to the AIoD platformâ€™s workflow engine, currently implemented as an instance of
            <a target="_blank" href="https://reanahub.io/">REANA</a> and REANA executes the Experiment Run.
        </li>
        <li>In REANA, a Docker container is started. AI Assets and environment variables are available globally in the
            container.</li>
        <li>A file called script.py, which contains the script defined in the Experiment Template, is executed.</li>
        <li>After the Experiment Run finishes, the Docker logs, metrics and output files (if any) are available on the
            details of the Experiment Run.</li>
    </ol>

    <p>
        To create an Experiment Run, you basically execute the Experiment. The Experiment Run is created and you can
        monitor its progress in the Experiment or Experiment Run detail page and through Experiment Run <code>state</code> property.
