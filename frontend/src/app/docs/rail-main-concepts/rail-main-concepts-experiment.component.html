    <h1>Experiment</h1>
    <p>
        Experiment is an executable instance of an Experiment template. Experiments are composed of AI assets and are
        executed in the AIoD platform. Experiments are reproducible and reusable.
    </p>
    <p>
        When you create an experiment, you select an Experiment Template that you want to use as a basis for your
        experiment. Then, you select a particular model(s), dataset(s) and values of environment variables that you want
        to
        use in your experiment.
    </p>

    <h1>Create Experiment</h1>
    <p>
        You can create an Experiment either through <a [routerLink]="['/docs', 'rail-sdks']">RAIL Python SDK</a> or
        through <a [routerLink]="['/experiments', 'templates', 'create']">web UI</a>.
    </p>

    <p>
        An example of an Experiment is shown below:

    <markdown src="assets/docs/markdown/codes/dataset-db-record.md" class="fixed-height-scrollable"></markdown>

    <p>
        When you create an Experiment, what happens is that a record defining the Experiment is saved to RAIL’s
        database.
        Immediately after that you are able to execute the Experiment.

    <h1>Execute Experiment</h1>
    <p>
        When you execute an Experiment, following happens:
    </p>
    <ol>
        <li>
            An instance of Experiment Run is created. This instance represents the current state of the running (and
            also finished) Experiment, its logs, metrics and outputs (if any). It is available in the Experiment detail
            page.
        </li>
        <li>
            The Experiment Run is transformed to a Common Workflow Language (CWL) file. This file represents the
            Experiment in the form of a workflow that is executable by AIoD platform infrastructure.
        </li>
        <li>
            The CWL file is sent to the AIoD platform’s workflow engine, currently implemented as an instance of
            <a target="_blank" href="https://reanahub.io/">REANA</a> and REANA executes the Experiment Run.
        </li>
        <li>In REANA, a Docker container is started. AI Assets and environment variables are available globally in the
            container.
        </li>
        <li>
            A file called script.py, which contains the script defined in the Experiment Template, is executed.
        </li>
        <li>
            After the Experiment Run finishes, the Docker logs, metrics and output files (if any) are available on the
            details of the Experiment Run.
        </li>
    </ol>
    <p>
        See <a [routerLink]="['/docs', 'main-concepts-run']">Experiment Run</a> section for more details.
