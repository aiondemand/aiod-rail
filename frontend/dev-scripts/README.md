These files are used to automatically generate models reflecting all the data models used
on the RAIL backend.

Incidentally, on backend there's an analogical script that automatically generates models
reflecting all the data models of the AIoD Metadata Catalogue itself

**Warning**: These scripts may be out-dated.
