  <h1>Main concepts of RAIL</h1>
  <p>
    RAIL allows AI practitioners to compose AI assets available in AIoD into executable experiments
    that are reproducible and reusable by introducing three main concepts: Experiment Template,
    Experiment and Experiment Run.
  </p>

  <h2>Experiment Template</h2>
  <p>
    <a [routerLink]="['/docs', 'main-concepts-template']">Experiment template</a> is a combination
    of <i>runtime environment</i>, <i>software dependencies</i> and <i>code</i>.
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>
      <b>Runtime environment</b> is a specification of the environment in which the experiment is
      executed. In RAIL, it is a specific Docker image.
    </li>
    <li>
      <b>Software dependencies</b> are the software packages that are required to execute the
      experiment. Currently, <code>requirements.txt</code> file with Python dependencies is
      supported.
    </li>
    <li><b>Code</b> is the code that is executed in the experiment.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    See "<a [routerLink]="['/docs', 'main-concepts-template']">Experiment Template</a>" section for
    more details.
  </p>
  <p>
    Experiment template on its own is not executable. You need to create an
    <a [routerLink]="['/docs', 'main-concepts-experiments']">Experiment</a> based on a specific
    template to be able to execute it. The Experiment defines particular parameters that are
    injected into the Template through Environment variables to make it executable. These include AI
    model, dataset (their name and AIoD ID) and environment variables supported by the template
    (they are defined by the author).
  </p>

  <!-- ================================================== -->
  <h2>Experiment</h2>
  <p>
    <a [routerLink]="['/docs', 'main-concepts-experiments']">Experiment</a> is a particular
    executable instance of an Experiment template. Experiments are composed of AI assets and are
    executed in the AIoD platform. Experiments are reproducible and reusable.
  </p>
  <p>
    When you create an experiment, you select an Experiment template that you want to use as a basis
    for your experiment. Then, you select particular AI assets and values of environment variables
    that you want to use in your experiment.
  </p>

  <!-- ================================================== -->
  <h2>Experiment Run</h2>
  <p>
    <a [routerLink]="['/docs', 'main-concepts-run']">Experiment Run</a> is created when you execute
    an Experiment. When you execute an experiment, the following happens under the hood:
  </p>
  <ol>
    <li>
      An instance of Experiment Run is created (it is available in the
      <a [routerLink]="['/experiments']">Experiment page</a>).
    </li>
    <li>
      The definition of an Experiment is transformed into a
      <a href="https://www.commonwl.org" target="_blank">CWL (Common Workflow Language)</a> file.
    </li>
    <li>The CWL file is sent to AIoD REANA instance and executed in the AIoD platform.</li>
    <li>
      A Docker container is started. AI Assets and environment variables are available globally in
      the container.
    </li>
    <li>A file called <code>script.py</code> is executed.</li>
    <li>
      After the Experiment Run finishes, the Docker logs, metrics and output files (if any) are
      available on the detail of the Run.
    </li>
  </ol>
